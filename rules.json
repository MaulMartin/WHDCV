            "TYRANIDS\nARMY RULES\nSYNAPSE\nSome Tyranids serve as synaptic conduits or nodal \nrelays through which a portion of the Hive Mind\u2019s \niron will flows, overriding the natural instincts of the \nswarm to direct the teeming warrior-beasts to function \nas a single, gestalt organism on the battlefield. \nIf your Army Faction is Tyranids, while a Tyranids \nunit from your army is within 6\" of one or more \nSynapse models from your army, that unit is said to \nbe within Synapse Range of your army. Each time a \nTyranids unit from your army takes a Battle-shock \ntest, if it is within Synapse Range of your army, take \nthat test on 3D6 instead of 2D6.\nSHADOW IN THE WARP\nTyranids flood the battlefield with the psychic \nsignature of the hive fleet, an icy, alien dread that \ngnaws at the minds of their prey and smothers even \nthe most stalwart courage. When faced with such \nunfathomable horror, many are driven insane or suffer \ncatastrophic neural damage.\nIf your Army Faction is Tyranids, once per battle, in \neither player\u2019s Command phase, if one or more units \nfrom your army with this ability are on the battlefield, \nyou can unleash the Shadow in the Warp. When you \ndo, each enemy unit on the battlefield must take a \nBattle-shock test. \n",

The combined total of these is your Cabal points pool. During the battle round, you can use \nRituals from the list below, deducting the Cabal points cost of each one from your Cabal points pool. If you do \nnot have enough Cabal points for a Ritual, you cannot use it. Each Ritual can only be used once per phase.

To do so, roll eight D6. You can then use those dice \nto activate up to two Blessings of Khorne from the \nBlessings of Khorne list (see right). Each Blessing of \nKhorne specifies the dice results it requires (where \na number is specified, a double or triple of that \nvalue or higher is required).

This is done using Miracle dice.\nGAINING MIRACLE DICE\nIf your Army Faction is Adepta Sororitas, you gain 1 \nMiracle dice:\n \u25a0At the start of each turn.\n \u25a0 Each time an Adepta Sororitas unit from your \narmy is destroyed.\nEach time you gain a Miracle dice, roll one D6. The \nnumber you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This \nvalue cannot be changed or re-rolled, unless a rule \nspecifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice \nto one side \u2013 this is your Miracle dice pool. PERFORMING AN ACT OF FAITH\nBefore making a dice roll for a model or unit from your \narmy with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one \nor more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can \nperform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the \ndice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that \ndice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a \nCharge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can \nbe substituted). The dice that is being substituted is \nnot rolled; instead the value of the selected Miracle \ndice is used as if it had been rolled (this counts as \nan unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules \npurposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for \nsubstitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions \nhave been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice \nfrom your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, \nunsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You \ncan use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of \nFaith for any of the following types of dice roll:\n \u25a0 Advance roll\n \u25a0Battle-shock test\n \u25a0Charge roll\n \u25a0Damage roll\n \u25a0Hit roll\n \u25a0Saving throw\n \u25a0Wound roll\nExample: Instead of rolling 2D6 to take a unit\u2019s \nBattle-shock test, you could use one dice from \nyour Miracle dice pool. If the value of that dice was \n4, the unit\u2019s Battle-shock test would be determined \nby rolling one D6 and adding 4 to it (i.e. it would \nbe D6+4).\n",

            "GREY KNIGHTS\nARMY RULE\nThe soul of the Grey Knights is sacrosanct, and their purity is incorruptible. The silvered armour of this \nChapter\u2019s warriors is bound with incantations, engraved with sigils of warding. Their blades shine with the inner \nlight of their sanctity, for each of these Space Marines is a psychic warrior, in empyric communion with his \nbattle-brothers. Empowered by minds constantly on guard, they can cut steel with bare hands, their eyes blaze \nwith fire and even the power of their words flays the otherworldly skin of daemons. They are the Imperium\u2019s \nforemost sword and shield against the daemonic. Guided by the foresight and prophecies of the Chapter\u2019s \nPrognosticars, a Grey Knight can adapt to the most irrational of foes and, in a flare of teleportation energies, \nemerge at exactly the right location to unleash their devastating power.\nTELEPORT ASSAULT\nIf your Army Faction is Grey Knights, at the end of \nyour opponent\u2019s turn, you can select a number of \nGrey Knights units from your army with this ability \n(excluding units that are within Engagement Range \nof one or more enemy units). The maximum number \nof units you can select depends on the battle size, \nas follows:\nCOMBAT PATROL UP TO 1 UNIT\nINCURSION UP TO 2 UNITS\nSTRIKE FORCE UP TO 3 UNITS\nONSLAUGHT UP TO 4 UNITS\nOnce you have made your selections, \nremove those units from the battlefield. In \nthe Reinforcements step of your next \nMovement phase, set each of those \nunits up anywhere on the battlefield \nthat is more than 9\" horizontally \naway from all enemy models. \nAny units that are not on \nthe battlefield at the \nend of the battle count \nas destroyed.\n",

When a \nlightning-fast purgation is required, orbiting strike \ncruisers maintain a constant spiritual lock on their \nbattle-brothers, enabling Grey Knights to perform \nshort-ranged teleportations. Flickering in and out \nof reality, this exceptional mobility allows them to \noutmanoeuvre the most otherworldly of enemies.\nEach time a Grey Knights unit with the Deep Strike \nability Advances, do not make an Advance roll. \nInstead, until the end of the phase, add 6\" to that \nunit\u2019s Move characteristic and that unit can Fly .\n",

Once a Dread ability is active \nfor your army, that ability applies until the end of \nthe battle.\nBATTLE ROUND 1  ONWARDS\nFrom the first battle round onwards, the Despair \nability is active for your army:\nDESPAIR (AURA)\nWhile an enemy unit is within 12\" of this model, \neach time that enemy unit takes a Battle-shock or \nLeadership test, subtract 1 from that test.\nBATTLE ROUND 3  ONWARDS\nFrom the third battle round onwards, the Doom and \nDarkness ability is active for your army:\nDOOM AND DARKNESS\n \u25a0 Each time this model makes an attack, if the target \nis Battle-shocked, add 1 to the Wound roll. \n \u25a0 Each time an attack targets this model, if the \nattacking model\u2019s unit is Battle-shocked, subtract 1 \nfrom the Hit roll. \nSUPER-HEAVY WALKER\nEach time a model with this ability makes a Normal, \nAdvance or Fall Back move, it can move over models \n(excluding Titanic models) and terrain features that \nare 4\" or less in height as if they were not there.\nDREADBLADES \nDreadblades often wander the galaxy, carving \na path of destruction and slaughtering foes \nalongside other forces of Chaos as and when \nthey will.\nIf every model in your army has the Chaos \nkeyword, you can include either 1 Titanic \nChaos Knights model or up to 3 War Dog \nmodels in your army, even if they do not have \nthe Faction keyword you selected in the Select \nArmy Faction step.

            "NECRONS\nARMY RULE\nThe scattered dynasties of the Necrons pursue many \ndifferent paths to dominance, embracing their own \ntraditions and martial doctrines. All dynasties also benefit \nfrom the nigh-supernatural technologies that once saw \nthem dominate the galaxy, perhaps the most unsettling \nof which are their reanimation protocols. Should a Necron \nbe slain, its body becomes wreathed in an eerie glow. \nCrawling limbs reattach, sundered torsos and smashed \nskulls reform and the Necron rises again, shambling back \ninto battle.\nREANIMATION PROTOCOLS\nIf your Army Faction is Necrons, at the end of your \nCommand phase, each unit from your army with this \nability activates its Reanimation Protocols and reanimates \nD3 wounds. Each time such a unit reanimates a wound:\n \u25a0 If that unit contains one or more models with fewer \nthan their starting number of wounds remaining, \nselect one of those models; that model regains one \nlost wound. \n \u25a0 If all models in that unit have their starting number of \nwounds, but that unit is not at its Starting Strength, \none destroyed model is returned to that unit with one \nwound remaining. \nOnce such a unit is at its Starting Strength and all of its \nmodels have their starting number of wounds, nothing \nfurther happens.\nExample: A unit of Lokhust Destroyers (which have a \nWounds characteristic of 3) activates its Reanimation \nProtocols. The unit had a Starting Strength of 3, but \ncurrently contains 2 models, and one of those models \nhas lost 1 wound. A 3 is rolled to see how many \nwounds are reanimated. The first of these reanimated \nwounds restores the wounded Lokhust Destroyer \nback to 3 wounds. The second of these reanimated \nwounds returns the destroyed Lokhust Destroyer to the \nbattlefield with 1 wound remaining. The third of these \nreanimated wounds restores one of the remaining lost \nwounds to the same Lokhust Destroyer that was just \nreturned. The unit now contains 3 models, two \nof which have 3 wounds remaining and one of \nwhich has 2 wounds remaining.\n",

Taken at \nthe right time, a simple action can avoid calamitous outcomes, aiding the \nAeldari in their continued struggle for survival.\nSTRANDS OF FATE\nIf your Army Faction is Aeldari, at the start of the \nbattle, make a Strands of Fate roll by rolling twelve D6. \nIf you wish, you can then re-roll all of these dice, but \nif you do, roll one less D6. You can continue re-rolling \nall of the dice in this manner, rolling one less D6 each \ntime you do, until you are satisfied with the results \nrolled (or until you only have a single D6 remaining). \nWhen you are satisfied with the results rolled, those \nremaining dice become your Fate dice for the battle. \nThese results cannot be changed or re-rolled further, \nunless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your \nFate dice to one side \u2013 this is your Fate dice pool.\nBefore making a dice roll for a model or unit from your \narmy with the Strands of Fate ability, if you have one \nor more dice in your Fate dice pool, you can use one \nof those Fate dice. To do so, select one of those Fate \ndice to substitute that dice roll. The dice that is being \nsubstituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the \nselected Fate dice is used as if it had been rolled (this \ncounts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all \nrules purposes). Each Fate dice can only be used in \nthis way once. After using a Fate dice, remove it from \nyour Fate dice pool and roll all remaining dice that are \npart of that dice roll (if any). You can use Fate dice for \nany of the following types of dice roll:\n \u25a0Advance roll\n \u25a0Battle-shock test\n \u25a0Charge roll\n \u25a0Damage roll\n \u25a0Hit roll\n \u25a0Saving throw\n \u25a0Wound roll\n",

Troupes of Harlequins \nand piratical bands of Corsairs accompany \nmany Drukhari raids, free from constrictive paths \nto pursue profits and fated agendas across \nthe galaxy.\nIf your Army Faction is Drukhari, you can include \nHarlequins and Anhrathe units in your army, \neven though they do not have the Drukhari \nFaction keyword.

To some once-allies she and her ideals \nhave become an immovable rift, yet between \nsome once-enemies her influence has sewn \nbonds of fellowship once thought impossible.\nIf your Army Faction is Aeldari and your Warlord \nis Yvraine, you can include Drukhari units in \nyour army, even though they do not have the \nAeldari Faction keyword. The combined points \nvalue of such units you can include in your army \ndepends on the battle size, as follows:\n \u25a0Incursion: Up to 500 pts\n \u25a0Strike Force: Up to 1000 pts\n \u25a0Onslaught: Up to 1500 pts\nNo Drukhari models included in your army in \nthis way can be given Enhancements.

Their leaders make swift and careful \ncalculations before and during battle, constantly striving to determine if the potential reward of conflict is worth \nthe inevitable loss of resources and precious Kin lives. An essential part of this is what is known as casting the \nEye of the Ancestors, through which Kin commanders assess the greatest enemy threats, mark weak points in \ntheir defences and determine what forces are needed to overcome both.\nEYE OF THE ANCESTORS\nIf your Army Faction is Leagues of Votann, each time \nan enemy unit destroys a Leagues of Votann unit \nfrom your army, that enemy unit gains 1 Judgement \ntoken. An enemy unit can never have more than 2 \nJudgement tokens (any further Judgement tokens a \nunit would gain beyond this are ignored).\nEach time a model from your army with this ability \nmakes an attack that targets a unit that has one or \nmore Judgement tokens, until that model\u2019s attacks \nhave been resolved, apply the relevant bonus from \nthe table below to that attack.\nJUDGEMENT  \nTOKENSBONUS\n1 Eminent Threat: Add 1 to the Hit roll.\n2Now We\u2019ve Got a Grudge to Settle: \nAdd 1 to the Hit roll and add 1 to the \nWound roll.Designer\u2019s Note: If a unit with Judgement tokens is \nremoved from the battlefield, make a note of how \nmany Judgement tokens it had when it was removed. \nIf that unit is set up on the battlefield again, place \nthe corresponding number of Judgement tokens next \nto it. If a unit with Judgement tokens splits up into \ntwo or more smaller units, each of those units gains \na number of Judgement tokens equal to that of the \noriginal unit. If two units combine to form a single \nlarger unit and either of those units had Judgement \ntokens, make a note of how many the unit with the \nmost has, just before they combine \u2013 the new unit \nhas a number of Judgement tokens equal to this.\n",
